      content="Hey! I am Fabian Grutsch and currently working as a Backend Engineer at Firstbird where we are building a SaaS referral platform using Scala, Akka, Playframework, and AWS. Currently, I am living in my hometown which is based in Tyrol, Austria. As Firstbird has its HQ in Vienna (Austria) I am working for more than 4 years now from a Coworking Space. I love nature and adventure, especially hiking, ski touring, mountain biking, and exploring the Alps. Other than that I am also interested in contributing to open source projects, professionally and in private."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
